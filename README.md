# todo-beast

## About
This project is a To-Do list application. You can add new tasks, mark them as done, edit and delete them, and filter the list by status. Just basic stuff for this kind of app.

## Tech information
The application is written with React using [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid) package. The application stores data in localStorage.

## If it looks familiar
If you're a developer reading this, this project's markup may look familiar. This is because I have learned the teaching about React on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning). But this project is not just a "copy-paste". I understood all the approaches, hooks, technial details and architecture of the project (if I can say that about projects of this sort of scale). I have written it twice myself to make sure that I had learnt all the mentioned materials on MDN.
